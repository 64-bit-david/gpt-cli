A simple cli app for interacting with the chat-gpt client.

This will require a openai api key stored in a GPT_API_KEY environment variable.
Then open the directory location and enter "go" to execute the bat file to start the application.

Useful tip: I use this often in windows terminal, to ensure it is ready to go each time I open terminal I have this in the settings.json file

    "startupActions": "new-tab -p \"Command Prompt\" --title \"Desktop\" -d \"C:\\Users\\david\\Desktop\" ; new-tab -p \"Command Prompt\" --title \"Assistant ðŸ¤–\" -d \"C:\\Users\\david\\Desktop\\Coding\\projects\\gpt_cli\" --tabColor #00CED1 ",

This automatically opens two terminal tabs, one in desktop which is where I like to have a starting directory location, and the other is this application which I find handy to have.
If you want to do this make sure to update the path to the appropriate directories.
